To predict the global climate based on annual surface temperature on land analysis

<h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>
Climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.

<h5>Climate Change Indicators</h5>
<p>1. Temperature changes<br>
   2. Wheather changes<br>
   3. Natural disasters<br>
   4. Global warming<br>
   5. Ozone depletion<br>
   6. Impacts on land<br>
   7. Impant on wlidlife plants<br>
   8. Exctintion of endangered animals etc.. these are main climate changes impacts on world

<h5>Goal of the project</h5>
<p>1. To know the factor which effects the chane in climate most<br>
   2. To get the clarity about the climate changes and decrease the factors by giving awarness to humans<br>
   3. To know the percentage of climate change happened in these years
